# AWS-notes

This repo contains notes I created while preparing for exam

I passed AWS SAA C02 exam using these notes, certificate: [Certificate Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HMEsZKvLRw0NlBsfSMJhIfr7q3yiM5Sf/view)

I will be continously updating and adding important points in this repository, watch this repo to get notifications for the same, star the repo if you find it useful.

Most of the notes are from this awesome [course](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate) by A Cloud Guru

Others have been taken from various sources like documentation, whitepapers, etc.
