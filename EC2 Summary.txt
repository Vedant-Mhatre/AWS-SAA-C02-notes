EC2 is a web service that provides resizeable compute capacity in the cloud

4 pricing options:

1. On Demand - fixed rate by the hour with no commitment

2. Reserved - Contract terms 1 year to 3 years, more upfront payment, more discount

3. Spot - Bid whatever price you want for instance capacity

4. Dedicated - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use, mainly used where lot of server-bound licenses exist

If spot instance is terminated by EC2, you will not be charged for partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.

types:

F - FPGA
I - IOPS
G - Graphics
H - High Disk Throughput
T - Cheap general purpose(T2 Micro, T3 Micro)
D - Density
R - RAM
M - Main choice for general purpose
C - Compute
P - Graphics(think Pics)
X - Xtreme Memory
Z - Extreme memory and Gpu
A - ARM based workloads
U - Bare Metal

Termination protection is turned OFF by default

On EBS backed instance, default action is for root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated 

EBS root volumes for default AMI can now be encryped when creating instance 

All inbound traffic is blocked by default

All outbound traffic is allowed

You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instance

Security groups are stateful - when you open port 80, it will be open for inbound as well as outbound

Network ACL are stateless

You cannot block specific IP addresses using security groups, instead use NACL

You can specify allow rules but not deny rules

Snapshots are incremental - only blocks that have changed since your last snapshot move to S3
